# caesar_cypher_challenge
<p>This challenge comprises the implementation of a simple algorithm with the requirement that your solution is implemented using test-driven development principles.</p> 

### Overview 
<p>The Caesar Cypher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. Messages are disguised by applying a fixed alphabetical shift to each letter in a string.</p>
<p> For example, if we were to encrypt the word ‘homeflowʼ using a key of 3, the encrypted message would be ‘krphiorzʼ.</p>

### Requirement
<p>Use test-driven development (using the test framework of your choice) to implement the Caesar Cypher in Ruby.</p>
